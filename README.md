Problem: fleets of EVs, limited grid power, dynamic prices.

Solution: smart scheduler that decides who charges when and how fast.

Tech: Python, math optimization now; AI/ML later.

Roadmap:

v0.1: math-based scheduler with simulated data

v0.2: simple dashboard

v0.3: first “AI” prediction (e.g., forecast demand/prices)
